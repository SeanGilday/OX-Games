Going to be the same concept of wordle. 
- Six tries to guess the five letter word
- If a letter is put in the correct place it will turn green
- If a letter is in the wrong spot but contained in the word it will turn yellow
- Used letters will be greyed out

The main difference is I want the word to be selected manually by the admin at the 
beginning of every day from a bank of words collected from the users
